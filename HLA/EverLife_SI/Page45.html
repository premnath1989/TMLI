    <td>Investment Strategy & Approach</td>
    <td>The main investment strategy is executed via portfolio
optimization methodology. The fund is open ended with
defined maturity date. The investment execution is
accomplished via a Floating Rate Negotiable Instrument of
Deposits (FRNID) issued by CIMB Bank Berhad.
The FRNID is principal protected at maturity by CIMB Bank.
The FRNID dynamically adjusts its exposure to the strategy,
such as to reduce exposure when the strategy has negative
performance and increase exposure when it has positive
performance.</td>
    <td>
      The fund would be actively managed, rotating between sectors deemed to benefit the most at any given point in time,
      and would comprise several Core Sectors and Trading / Rotational Sectors which would vary depending on prevailing market conditions.
      The strategy will be to identify the themes in its early phase to capitalize on its growth.
      This fund is suitable for aggressive investors who are willing to take higher risk and wish to seek higher returns from a diversified portfolio with thematic investment opportunities.
    </td>
    <td>At inception, this fund will invest by feeding into Hong
Leong Dana Maa&apos;rof and HLA Venture Dana Putra
(&ldquo;Target Funds&rdquo;) with the option to increase the
number of funds or replace the Target Funds in
future.
Generally, the Target Funds select undervalued
companies that have the potential to offer good
Medium-To-Long Term capital growth. In terms of
fixed income instruments, selection depends largely
on credit quality to assure relative certainty in profit
income, principal payment, and overall total return
stability.</td>
    <td>The strategy is to provide investors an affordable
access into a diversified investment portfolio with a
mixture of equities and fixed income instrument. The
fund will invest primarily in fixed income instruments
such as bonds, money market instruments, repo and
deposits with financial institutions that provide regular
income as well as in high dividend yield stocks to
enhance the fund&apos;s returns. The asset allocation
decision between fixed income instruments and equity
is decided after considering the fixed income and
equity market outlook over the medium to long-term
horizon. Initially the fund will invest by feeding into
Hwang Select Income Fund, with the option to
increase the number of funds or replace Hwang Select
Income Fund with other fund(s) in future.</td>
    <td>
      This fund may be placed with any licensed financial
institution under the Islamic Financial Services Act
2013, determined by the fund manager.
