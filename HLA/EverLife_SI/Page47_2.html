    <td>Risk</td>
    <td ><b>Market risk</b> &ndash; Market risk stems from the fact that there are other economy-wide perils, which
	  threaten all businesses. It is mainly caused by uncertainties in the economy, political and social
	  environment.<br/>
	  <b>Liquidity risk</b> &ndash; Liquidity risk is the risk that the fund invested cannot be readily sold and
	  converted into cash. This may arise when the trading volume is low and/or where there is a lack
	  of demand for the security.<br/>
	  <b>Credit risk</b> &ndash; This refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make
	  timely payments of interest or principal repayment on the maturity date. The default may lead
	  to a fall in the value of the funds.<br/>
	  <b>Interest rate risk</b> &ndash; The level of interest rates has an impact on the value of investments. Any
	  increase in rates will lead to a fall in the value of securities, thus affecting the value of the
	  funds.<br/>
	  <b>Country risk</b> &ndash; The foreign investment of a fund may be affected by the political & economic
	  conditions of the country which the investments are made.<br/>
	  <b>Currency Risk</b> &ndash; This risk is associated with investments that are denominated in foreign
	  currencies. Fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have an impact on the value of the funds.<br/>
	  <b>Deleverage Risk</b> &ndash; Deleveraging may occur if the bond floor rises due to falling interest-rates or
	  due to nearing maturity, or due to sustained underperformance of the underlying asset. When
	  this occurs, the Funds will unwind all allocation to the underlying asset and will effectively
	  become a zero-coupon bond fund.<br/>
	  <b>Performance risk</b> &ndash; There is no guarantee on the investment returns which may be affected
	  by the above mentioned risks.
